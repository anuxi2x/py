Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List - a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple - a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set - a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary - a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

*Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
