range() is a special type of object, that returns an object that produces a sequence of integers from start to stop by step

for number in range(0, 10):
    print('something)

output will be: 10 times 'something'

if we dont need number variable we can replace it by underscore(_)

well, range creates a special kind of object that we can iterate over

range(start, stop, step)
