enumerate() returns an enumerate object. Iterable must be another object that supports iteration
in enumerate() we wrap around something that we want to enumerate
its going to take an iterable object and gives us an index counter and the item at that index 

for index, char in enumerate('Hello'):
    print(index, char)

output will be:
0 H
1 e
2 l
3 l
4 o

works with any iterables - string, list, tuple, set, dict
