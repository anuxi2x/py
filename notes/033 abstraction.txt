abstraction means hiding information or abstracting away information and giving access to only whats necessary
so whatever the user or the programmer or the machine is interested in, thats the only thing we give access to, everything else we king of hide it, becaise users dont have to worry about it

private and public variables is the base of abstraction

there are not true privacy
_something (single underscore) means that this should be a private variable and for others that you cant override this within using
__something__ (double underscore) (dunder method) means that its a built in into python
we should never write double underscore, its bad practice
