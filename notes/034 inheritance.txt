inheritance allows new object to take on the properties of existing objects, so we can inherit classes

class User():
    def sign_in(self):
        print('u r logged in')

class Wizard(User):
    def __init__(self, name, power):
        self.name = name
        self.power = power
    def attack(self):
        print(f'attack of power of {self.power}')

by giving User as parameter to Wizard: Wizard is inherit from User and have his own methods

isinstance(instance, Class) - is a built in function, which checks if instance is instance of Class or not, returns boolean

Wizard class is a subclass of User
User is subclass of object
all subclasses inherit from methods from object
