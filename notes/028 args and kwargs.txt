we have the *args which allow us to grab these positional arguments and just sum everything
we have the **kwargs which allow us to grab anu number of keyword arguments and get a dictionary which comes as keyword arguments and the use them however we want
in our case, we are looping over all the values, so items in keyword argument values, and the we goin to total all those items, have a total and add sum

def super_func(*args, **kwargs):
    total = 0
    for items in kwargs.values():
        total += items
    return sum(args) + total

*args is a tuple
**kwargs is a dictionary

Rule of parameters:
actual params, **args, default parameters, **kwargs
