iterable is something that is able to get looped over
iterable allows us to use the notation of a for something in an iterable to iterate over each item

for iterables its easy to iterate
lets have an example of dictionaries, because there are key:value pairs

user = {
    'name': 'golem',
    'age': 5006,
    'can_swim': False
}

to have an objects we can use

for item in user.items():
    print(item)

output will be:
('name', 'golem')
('age', 5006)
('can_swim', False)


for item in user.values():
    print(item)

output will be:
golem
5006
False


for item in user.keys():
    print(item)

output will be:
name
age
can_swim


the way to have them seperately
for key, value in user.items():
    print(key, value)

otuput will be:
name golem
age 5006
can_swim False
