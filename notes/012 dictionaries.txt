it's a data type in python, but it's also a data structure
its a way to organize our data in a form that is has some different pros and cons and how we access it

dictiornary = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2
}

dictionary is unordered key:value pair from 3.7 version dictionary is ordered

to access key using value
dictionary['a']

dictiornary = {
    'a': [1, 2, 3],
    'b': 2
}

dictionary['a'][1] - will return 2

Dictionary keys needs to be immutable - key cannot change
Dictionary key has to be unique

dict() built-in function which creates a new dicitonary
example:
user = dict(name = 'py') will creates a dicitonary {name = 'py'}

Print the number of items in the dictionary:
print(len(thisdict))

print('basket' in user) returns True or False
